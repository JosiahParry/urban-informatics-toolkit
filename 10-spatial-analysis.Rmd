# Spatial Analysis

* What is spatial data?
  - events happen at a location and are associate with place
  - data become spatial when there is a geographic element present
  - the most obvious is when lat and long data are present
  - data which lists county, for example, is also spatial
    - often there isn't spatial data explicitly associated
* Types of spatial data
  - Vector and Raster
  - in gneral you will encounter vector data more frequently. 
  - vector data are coordinates
  - raster data is used to "represent spatially continuous phenomenon"
    - (https://rspatial.org/raster/spatial/Spatialdata.pdf)
  - vector data is less complex to analyse and is the easiest to pick up
  - raster data is extremely interesting but requires more devoted attention
    - raster data analysis can be done to look at changing elevation, analyse vegatation, the amount of reflective surfaces, etc
