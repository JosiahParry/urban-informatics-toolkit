# Summary statistics 



The last chapter we focused on the underlying data structures that we interact with in R. Most importantly we covered the atomic vector data structure and learned that the columns of a tibble are vectors. When we have been using `mutate()` we have been creating other vectors. When we have filtered data, we have checked the values of the underlying vectors to see if they have matched our specified conditions. Moving forward, we will begin to think about ways of summarizing our data. To do so we will be working with vectors more often. Being able to understand the role a vector plays in data frame operations will make this learning process even easier. 

## Statistics

Let us start by asking the question _"what is a statistic?"_

Very simply a statistic is a single number that is used to characterize a sample of data. Most often we see statistics used to describe data's are usually characterized by its central tendancy and spread. Measures

- measures of central tendency
- measures of spread
- basic functions used
  - mean, median, & sd
