# Welcome

Welcome to the Urban Informatics Toolkit! 
This book will provide you with an introduction to some of the history of Urban Informatics as a field, important concepts in the field, and provide you with the skills required to jumpstart your own exploration of the urban commons.

I have always struggled with overly academic writing and overly technical and obtuse descriptions of concepts, tasks, and phenomena that can be written in easy to understand ways. 

my goal for this text is to provide you with a non-technical instruction to a technical topic. I want this to be friendly and not adversarial nor patronizing. I will do my best to try and explain this language and topics the way that I would to my friends over a beer.


## What to expect

- This book is partitioned into chapters where each goes over a small subset of skills that is important to know and a few case studies. 
- the first half of the book will introduce you to the basic tools that you will need to know to become self-sufficient. From there on, we will work with case studies that also introduce new topics and further more advances skills
- In Part II each chapter, with a few exceptions, will introduce you to a social phenomenon. We will ask a question, and use a relevant dataset to answer this question. While we work to approach each question, we will pause to learn about the tools that we are using, understand what they are doing and why. There will _always_ be a TL;DR for each chapter recapping what we covered, and links to further resources. 
- technical chapters will be interspersed with non-techinical chapters.

### Structure of the Book

## Reminders

Learning to program can be exceptionally difficult at times. It can be a roller coaster of emotions. It is expected that you will not understand everything the first go around. Do not get down on yourself. I encourage you to take breaks and not push yourself too hard. I understand you have deadlines, but sometimes it is better if you take a break, eat a healthy snack, go exercise, sleep, be social, etc and then come back. You will be much happier and your work will be even better and that I promise you! 

Perhaps I am showing my cards a bit too much, but I have always found that with tough assignments it is better to go to bed early and finish them in the morning than it is to stay up exceptionally late. Moral of that story is, get some sleep and take care of yourself! I'll be sure to remind you from time to time.


Text analysis

* unstructured text as data
* what is the scope and limitations of text data?
* working with text data:
  * stop words
  * tokenization
