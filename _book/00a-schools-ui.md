# Approaches to and Schools of Urban Informatics 



## Scientific approaches

In the sciences generally, there are two approaches to scientific inquiry: inductive and deductive. These two approaches can be best characterized as “bottom up” and “top down” respectively. Each has their own origins, strengths, and weaknesses. An argument has been raging—in the scientific sense of raging—since the 17th century about which approach is the best one. My answer to this? Both, and neither. And you’ll see why shortly. 

Let’s start by getting a grasp on deductive approaches (also referred to as deduction). With deduction we start with a theory about the workings of some observed phenomenon. From this theory, we create a hypothesis, then observe (or collect data on) the phenomenon. With this data we then confirm or refute our theory. This is how we all have, most likely, been taught about the scientific method. 

Induction works in a reverse order. It works by looking at the natural world and doing just that, looking. It works by noticing something—a pattern, a unique occurrence—then noticing it again, and then again, and then under slightly different conditions. From those observations, we draw hypothesis. We then observe yet again and see if we can refute or add a little bit more credibility to our findings. Then from doing this time and again, we can build a theory. It’s somewhat like Sherlock and Watson finding clues and then coming to (frighteningly specific) conclusions. These theories, no matter how we get there, are the frameworks that we use to try and explain phenomena that we see. 

## The Chicago School

Much of what is known as the urban sciences today can be traced back to the late 19th and early 20th centuries at the University of Chicago. The University of Chicago was at the time the epicenter of the new field of American Sociology which came to be known as the Chicago School. In that era, the social sciences were seeking to create grand theories of the world. Take, for example, the new field of Anthropology that crafted theories about the origins of the human race. The Chicago School "fostered a very different view of sociology: first-hand data collection was to be emphasized; research on the particular case or setting was to be stressed; induction over deduction was to be promoted" (Turner, 1988). 

Scholars such as Robert Park, Ernest Burgess, and Louis Wirth developed a number of micro-theories to understand the city. Most notably is the culminating work The City by Park and Burgess, a collection of essays that encapsulate decades of careful observation that led to a number of theories that still have influence today. Their body of work, important in so many ways, is an early paragon of an inductive approach to social research. 

## Complexity and Santa Fe Institute 

On the other end of the spectrum rest the Santa Fe Institute (SFI) and their complexity science.

- Their mission is to “Our researchers endeavor to understand and unify the underlying, shared patterns in complex physical, biological, social, cultural, technological, and even possible astrobiological worlds” 
- In a sense they are after the master theory
- they call this complexity science. 
- They, like myself, take the view that “valuable ideas are often confined to the echo chambers of academia.” And for the most part, they aren’t wrong. 
- Adapt scientific methods and theories from the physical sciences to those of the social nature
- use  “theories of scaling from biology” to contribute to urban planning
- focus on the interconnectivity of the world
- that if you can understand the networks you can understand the world

## A Hybrid Approach 

As part of this proliferation of big data we have more and better data within reach. As such we are able to, perhaps even encouraged to, take a much more hybrid approach. Within the these data are a multitude of opportunities to explore and glean patterns that we may have been so subtle that it hasn't been observed before. Or, alternatively, the data had not been collected before. This allows us to take a much more inductive approach where we can craft theories from the patterns that we observe, then we can test those theories in creative ways. It is here where, I believe, that the Boston Area Research Initiative (BARI) rests on the spectrum.

This hybrid methodology incorporates both inductive and deductive approaches.
- BARI is a product of this proliferation of data with a lot of influence coming directly from the Chicago School

- what do you think is the ideal approach? is it one or the other? a blend? something entirely new?
