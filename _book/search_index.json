Ecometrics represent a quantitative representation of physical and social environment. In the Urban Informatics context, ecometrics are created to extract latent constructs—or variables that can only be inferred from a dataset—that illustrate some physical or social phenomenon. To understand this, we need to again contextualize these datasets. They are not created with the intention of beng analyzed or to measure the blight of a neighborhood or the social unrest of a city. The data may tell a story of an underserved neighborhood or of a gilded community with a beautiful brick façade with next to no collective efficacy efforts. These datasets contain gems—beautifully inelegant snapshots of the societal quotidien. But measuring that? That’s the tough part and that is why we create ecometrics. They provide us with a way to adapt existing data to address new problems. Of the work that BARI conducts, the production of city-wide ecometrics of social and physical disorder are most emblematic of this hybrid approach. To understand this work we need to venture back to 1982 and an article from the Atlantic called Broken Windows. 5.1 Broken Windows Theory Broken windows theory is a framework for explaining the occurrence of crimes. Broken windows emphasizes the role that public disorder and private conflict have in predicting crime. The theory comes from a famous 1982 article in which the imagery of a broken window was used to illustrate social disorder (Wilson and Kelling, 1982). They then hypothesized that criminals are emboldened by the presence of disorder. Broken windows has historically captured the attention of policy makers. The vast public support has led to a large body of work largely disputing the merits of this theory. In the process of doing so, much work has gone into actually quantifying disorder in a city. In a seminal article by Sampson and Raudenbush (1999), the practice of systematic social observation was created. This is a process in which imagery of public spaces is taken and coded to identify disorder—i.e. the presence of empty beer cans—which can then be quantitatively analyzed. This has become known as ecometrics. O’Brien &amp; Sampson, 2015 Public and Private It was the seminal article of Wilson and Kelling (1982), however, that launched disorder to the public stage. Writing in The Atlantic, they invoked the powerful metaphor of ‘‘broken windows’’ to capture the idea of public disorder and its hypothesized link to the unraveling of public spaces. Wilson and Kelling asserted that visual cues of disorder provoke fear among urban residents and that disorder begets predatory crime and neighborhood decline.1 As a basic description of the urban landscape, the broken windows claim of a connection between high levels of disorder and crime has largely been supported Traditional interpretations of broken windows theory argue that dis- order precipitates a cycle of ‘‘disorder and decline,’’ as it has been dubbed by Skogan Despite much research, the body of work on broken windows theory leaves open the central question: Does disorder contribute to the ongoing decline of a neighborhood? And, if so, through what behavioral and social pathways does it do so? Taking up this challenge, O’Brien, Sampson, and Winship (2015) have proposed a methodology for ecometrics in the age of digital data, identify- ing three main issues with such data and articulating steps for addressing each. These are (1) identifying relevant content, (2) assessing validity, and (3) establishing criteria for reliability. 􏰉 Public social disorder, such as panhandlers, drunks, and loud disturbances; 􏰉 Public violence that did not involve a gun (e.g., fight); 􏰉 Private conflict arising from personal relationships (e.g., domestic violence); 􏰉 Prevalence of guns violence, as indicated by shootings or other inci- dents involving guns; and 􏰉 Alcohol, including public drunkenness or public consumption of alcohol.

I say most noteably because of its approach it combines an inductive approach with a deductive one. this is the quintessence of the Boston approach, of course it comes from Dan O’Brien. why?: big data (actually big-ish which is rare in social science) The development and use of ecometrics (induction) deliberately testing an existing theory (deduction) Absolutely crushing it. what is an ecometric? why is it inductive? taking naturally occuring data, and extracting latent (already existing variables) "],
