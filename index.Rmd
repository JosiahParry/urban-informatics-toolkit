# Project Description

The study of Urban Informatics is inherently intertwined with big data. Working with big data requires a set of skills that extends beyond quantitative and qualitative analysis expertise. Students need to know how to access, manipulate, analyze, communicate and share data artifacts. The intention of this practicum is to develop educational content to cultivate an expertise in data.

An online text and accompanying exercises will be created to teach students data science in a manner that is tailored toward Urban Informatics studies. Writing this content will provide an opportunity to synthesize the learnings and skills taught in the Urban Informatics program. The manner in which it will be done will also further access to the field and assist in the cultivation of future students.

I have always struggled with overly academic writing and overly technical and obtuse descriptions of concepts, tasks, and phenomena that can be written in easy to understand ways. 

my goal for this text is to provide you with a non-technical instruction to a technical topic. I want this to be friendly and not adversarial nor patronizing. I will do my best to try and explain this language and topics the way that I would to my friends over a beer.

## outline / notes

intro is what is ui
What is administrative data 
Current examples of the data driven city 
Why we need to learn data with theory
The data workflow
Question then data 
Data then questions new approach due to massive data 
There are many insights yet to be discovered 
R 
The hard part is getting started. I want to make this as easy as possible with social science and UI examples bear with me for a bit. 
* Basics as a calculator
* Visualization / Visualizing relationships / Visuializing relationships
  * the type of the data that we have will dictate how we visualize it
  * Univariate
  * Bivariate
* Data Manipulation
  * filtering data
Tidy and untidy data
* tidy data: 
  * this is just to introduce you to the idea and get an idea of what it looks like. No need to understand the code or anything that will show up afterwards.
  * the principles
  * demonstrate what it looks like
The boring part data structures 
Administrative data data cleaning manopulatoon 
Aggregation 

Introduce interacting with public data via webportals and APIs


Geospatial analysis: 

* data are often grounded in space
* its important to understand where things happen
* 3 Common data that are associated with space
  * 311 - point (vector data)
  * census tracts - polygon (vector)
  * sattelite imagery - raster (we wont cover this)
* polygon is the most simple to work with
  * visualization of aggregate data
  * aggregating by polygon (building permits)
* points are a bit trickier
  * often we want to join this 
  
  
Text analysis

* unstructured text as data
* what is the scope and limitations of text data?
* working with text data:
  * stop words
  * tokenization
