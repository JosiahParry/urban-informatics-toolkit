# Statistics

## T-test

Only covering two-sample


`t.test()`

- two vectors
- using a data frame
- the formula interface

## ANOVA


- we use anova when we want to test for 3 or more groups
- evaluates if there is _any_ statistically significant differences between groups
- we do not know _which_ groups, but just a group
- `aov()`
- uses the formula interface
- if we find that there may be statistically significant differences, we want to know between which groups there are differences.
- we do this with Tukey's HSD


### Tukey's HSD

Stands for Honestly Significant Difference 

The function is `TukeyHSD()`

creates comparisons for all pairings
