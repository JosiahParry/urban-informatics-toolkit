Preface: 

- Introductions:
  - UI
  - Big Data
  - Data Science
- R and RStudio
  - R as a calculator
  - the concept of functions
  - packages 
    - I need a good metaphor for packages and their relationship to base R

Toolkit Foundations:

- Visual Analysis
  - introduce exploratory data analysis and the concept of inductive science
  - introduce a curated ACS data set as one of the most foundational datasets in UI and Comp Soc. Sci
  - explore a social question and answer it using ggplot charts
    - the hope is to make them feel like they're off to the races doing cool stuff
- Reading Data
  - Describe different types of data
  - provide an intuition for flat text files
  - using `readr`
  - honorable mentions: excel, tvs, and json
- General Data Manipulation
  - level set with data cleaning as a necessity (80/20 rule)
  - introduce a scenario to frame the work
    - this is inteâ€šnded to be a light-hearted imaginary role play
  - the important ones: select(), filter(), mutate(),
  - the helpful ones: arrange(), count()
- Visualizing Trends:
  - the grammer of graphics
  - what to visualize when?
    - univariate
    - bivariate
    - going beyond two-variables
- Data Structures: vectors
  - describe data types and vector nuances 
- revisiting statistics:
  - it's important to introduce vectors first because we must have a very good udnerstanding of what they are if we will be creating statstistics. Statistics are taking many numbers and making one from all of those.
    - that is what we will do with `summarise()`
- the %>% for chainging functions
  - this is important 
- creating grouped summaries
