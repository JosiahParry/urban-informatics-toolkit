In the field of Urban Informatics, and the digital humanities more generally, there are three distinct scientific approaches. I will first introduce two of them and the expemplary schools from which they may be traced back to in urban studies. 

- i will first address inductive and deductive scientific processes each with an example
- lastly i will discuss a newer, more hybrid approach 


- inductive vs deductive approaches to science has been a point of argument since the 17th century. 
- these two theories can be best characterized as "top down" and "bottom up" approaches to
- deductive approaches (i.e. we are deducing) start with a theory about the workings of some observed phenomenon
  - this is how we have most likely been taught science 
  - then a hypothesis is created about the function of a theory
  - then we observe phenomena, collect data, and the confirm or refute our theory
- inductive approaches work in a reverse order
  - inductive approaches to science are characterized by making observations of the natural world 
  - observing some pattern in these observations
  - _then_ drawing tentative conclusions from them
  - try to observe the patten more frequently or in other locations and then confirm those hypothesis and then build a theory
  - think of sherlock and watson looking for clues and them coming to conclusions from them 



- what is a theory?
  - we can think of theories as frameworks that scientists use to explain observed phonemona

## Chicago School

- The University of Chicago plays a central role in both the creation of the field of american sociology and urban theory. 
- Research that came out of the sociology department of the University of Chicago in 1890s and early 20th century is called the chicago school. 
- at the time the social sciences were dominated by political science, anthropology, history, the new field of economics. 
  - they were highly critical of the new field of sociology
  - it was believed that general theory "confer[ed] academic respectability" (Roscoe Hinkle 1980, p 207 from Turner)
  - Chicago school "fostered a very different view of sociology: first-hand data collection was to be emphasized; research on the particular case or setting was to be stressed; induction over deduction was to be promoted"


- Sociological origins
- the chicago school
  - Park and Burgess
  - the key findings from _The City_
  - Discuss _how_ these findings were generated
    - inductive approaches to theory, ONLY
- the sante fe school
  - this is the complete other end of the example
  - sante fe is a group of physical scientists looking to use hyper-modern techniques and apply theory to observed social data
  - this group has a general set of theories that they use to evaluate urban life
- where does the Boston School fit in?
  - let's step back to understand the two general approaches to scientific inquiry
    1. Inductive - finding something from the data (think chicago)
    2. Deductive - having a theory and setting out to explicitly test that (think psychology experiment)
  - Overview of inductive
  - Overview of deductive
  - the Boston School is a hybrid approach
  - Next Chapter: Let us use the example of broken windows theory and the development of ecometrics
  
some questions to ponder:

- what is a strnegth of the chicago school?
- what is the strength of the santa fe institute?

- what do you think is the ideal approach? is it one or the other? a blend? something entirely new?
