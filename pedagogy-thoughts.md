I want the learning experience to be done through follow along analysis projects 
the datasets that will be used are real BARI datasets
When do you introduce the technical concepts. 

The R4DS approach is to "get you up to speed with the basic tools of data exploration as quickly as possible". This is arguably the most important bit and I think I agree. I do think, though, that I want to introduce theory behind vectors rather early on. 


How heavy into the _actual_ theory do I go?

Do I provide a review of the Chicago School?

2019-12-29: the data and code should all live in an rstudio.cloud project that will be copied

2020-01-11: when do i introduce measures of central tendency? what about summary stats? 

2020-01-12:
  - create a function which will write the datasets to a `data` directory in the current project
  - i need to have an intro to projects
  - or have at the very beginning a required reaading to get up and started
