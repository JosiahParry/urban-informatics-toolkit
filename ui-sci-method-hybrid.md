A new approach to the scientific method: 

The Scientific Method
Two main approaches to this.
Inductive and Deductive. Big data provides great opportunity for inductive research. There are many patterns waiting to be discovered. This is one of the reasons why it is so exciting to work in data science. inductive approaches can help us try and identify a theory but will not let us confirm that theory. We can observe the phenomenon, but

traditionally it's been deductive for theory development.
Big data allows more inductive analysis
this is a good opportunity for a hybrid approach where, through inductive analysis, we develop theory, then are able to test that theory in two ways.
  1. new data - how does the theory hold up under new observations?
  2. experimentation

Urban Informatics is a rather interesting field. It is the product of modernization and discipline integration. There are two very different ways of developing and applying theory. Historically much of Urban Studies have been deductive where phenomenon are observed and theories are developed to explain those. We then have been turning to data to confirm these theories. 

As the amount o data available to us is increasing, we are able, and perhaps even encouraged, to take a much more hybrid approach. Huge amounts of data is a rather enormous opportunity to explore and glean patterns that may have been too subtle to observe naturally or find more obscure or niche patterns. This allows us to take a much more inductive approach where we have been able to craft theories from patterns

Urban Informatics is a rather unique field. It is the hybridization of disciplines and methodological approaches. The variation in researcher backgrounds and methodological familiarities have also illustrated in differing approaches in the application of the scientific method to the study of cities.


The BARI paradigm to UI has largely been influenced by the Chicago school of urban sociology. The naissance of the school may be traced back to Park and Burgess's seminal book _The City_  (1925) which described cities as an environments with their own ecological processes where scarce resources and competition drive urban development. Aside from the importance and implications of theories that the Chicago school developed, we ought to also pay attention to _how_ they developed these theories. 

_The City_ is exemplary of the inductive approach that is used widely in the social sciences.

Inductive approaches to science are characterized by making observations of the natural world and then drawing conclusions from them. This is perhaps the essence of the scientific method and is the center of an argument stemming from the 17th century. The conclusions that are drawn from observation are used to create theories.

We can think of theories as frameworks that scientists use to explain observed phenomena.  But we must remind ourselves that when we develop a theory that is not the end of the science story. We have an obligation to test theory and see if they can hold their muster. 

In general there are two different ways in which we can test our theories. 

1. Evaluating our theories against new observations
2. Conducting experiments to test the application of theories directly 

{deductive reasoning}


## Ecometrics 
Central to the BARI approach to UI is the use of the generalized ecometric approach (O’Brien, 2018). This is a frame 

### Ecometric Case Study: Broken Windows Theory

Broken windows 1980s Atlantic Article. Inductive approach. Positited that social disorder led to crime. This was adapted into public policy and led to the development of stop and frisk policies. These folks developed a theory, but didn’t evaluate it. 




Example: broken windows theory. Systematic social observation 


----

- define inductive
- systematic observation 
  - Urban informatics is largely inductive too systematic social observation example
- the application and testing of theory is deductive 
- UI creates an opportunity for a largely hybrid approach

- induction is analysis & synthesis 
- deduction is confirmation/verification


"The subjective plays a role through what Whewell calls the Colligation of Facts, a creative act of the scientist, the invention of a theory. A theory is then confirmed by testing, where more facts are brought under the theory, called the Consilience of Inductions"

- differs from the deductive approach of the scientific method
